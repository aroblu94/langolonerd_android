# L'angolo nerd Android App
Android App for [L'angolo nerd](http://www.langolonerd.it)    
Basically it's a WebView used to show mobile version of the site with some useful features.   
    
The development follows the `git-flow branching pattern`, using `develop` as the _bleeding edge_ (and _more unstable_) branch and `master` as the _release branch_.    
Each feature will be developed on an indipendent `feature/feature_name` branch and, once finished, merged into the `develop` one.    

The app is developed using [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html) and is under [GPLv3 License](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html).
